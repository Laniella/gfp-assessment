# Git for Professionals Final Assessment

This repository contains the git exercise portion of the final assessment for the Git for Professionals course. You will need to follow the steps below to complete the assessment.

Keep these steps open in your web browser while you work on the assessment in Git Kraken. The goal is to complete all the fields in the template through Git operations.

1. Change branches to the "part-1" branch.
2. Edit the README to include your name as the author and commit the change.
3. Merge the active branch into the "part-2", preserving your name in the author field.
4. Revert your repo to the commit 2 before the merge on the "part-2" branch. The commit message should say "Added ISBN".
5. Go back to the merge commit you created before you should see the empty ISBN field. Add the ISBN from the previous commit back in.
6. To get the Title field, merge your branch with "part-3" now. Keep the author and ISBN fields as they are in your existing branch.
7. At this point, the README should show your name for the author, "ABCDEFGHIJKL" as the ISBN, and "Git for Professionals" as the title. If so, you have successfully completed the assessment!
